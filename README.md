# NOTE

I make absolutely no guarantees that these dot files will "just work"
if you dropped them in your .emacs.d. I don't keep track of every
little change I make or every package I install manually. So while
these files work on my machine, there is no reason to expect they will
work out of the box on any other machine without some manual tweaking.
